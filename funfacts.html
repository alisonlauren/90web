    <h3>Will</h3>  
    <img src="will.jpg" alt="will smith" width="200" height="300">
    </div>
    <p> Will is a street-smart and laid-back West Philadelphia teenager. <br> After Will gets into a fight his mother sends him to live with his <br> wealthy aunt and uncle (Vivian and Phillip Banks) in Bel-Air</p>
    <h3>Carlton</h3>
    <img src="carltonyellow.jpg" alt="carltonyellow" width="200" height="300"> 
    <p>Carlton is very unlucky when it comes to women. They often find him <br> unimpressive, arrogant, nerdy and obnoxious. At times when Carlton <br> does think he's found love, it's always revealed he's actually <br> being used in one way or another.</p>
    <h3>Uncle Phil</h3>
    <img src="phil2.jpg" alt="phil" width="200" height="300">
    <p>Even though Phillip tends to lose his temper fairly quickly, he means <br> well deep down, and he loves and cares deeply about his family. <br> Philip also loves food and had a pet pig when he remained young</p>
    <h3>Aunt Vivian</h3>
    <img src="viv.jpg" alt="viv" width="200" height="300">
    <p>She is a no-nonsense, vocally talented, forthright, aspiring, understanding, <br> nurturing, trusting, vivacious, independent, valiant, <br> industrious, astute, nice and career-minded woman who plays a part in <br> the show equal to her husband Philip</p>
    <h3>Ashley</h3>
    <img src="ashley.jpg" alt="ashley" width="200" height="300">
    <p>Ashley enjoys the time she spends with her mother, but is arguably the closest <br> with her cousin, Will, who is a huge inspiration to her. <br> Ashley looked up to Will as a big brother and spent much of her <br> time following him in her younger days.</p>
    <h3>Hilary</h3>
    <img src="hilary.jpg" alt="hilary" width="200" height="300">
    <p>Sometimes very dim-witted and extremely self-centered, who can come off as an <br> arrogant airhead; she looks down on Will's upbringing and is <br> obsessed with shopping and money. However, despite her apparent <br> shallow personality, she has a strong sense of integrity</p>
